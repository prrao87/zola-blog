## Hello! 👋🏽

I'm an A.I. engineer with a passion for building intelligent, automated applications using a range of databases, tools and frameworks. My primary interests include database systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), information extraction, machine learning and reasoning over knowledge graphs.

I'm based in Toronto 🇨🇦, and have previously lived in Vancouver 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor, Michigan 🇺🇸. I love writing technical content and digging into the internals of tools and frameworks, typically Python and Rust. I'm also a big fan of open source software and open knowledge-sharing. If you like what you're reading in the [blog](./posts), consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/prrao87). 🫶🏼

This site is built using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), a fast, lightweight static site generator written in Rust. I hope you have fun reading, and let's go build more things in Rust! 🦀
