## Hello! 👋🏽

I'm an A.I. engineer with a passion for building intelligent, automated applications using a range of databases, tools and frameworks. My primary interests include database systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), information extraction, machine learning and reasoning over knowledge graphs.

I love writing technical content and digging into the internals of tools and systems. I'm also a big fan of open source software and open knowledge sharing. If you like what you're reading in the [blog](./posts), consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/prrao87). 🫶🏼
