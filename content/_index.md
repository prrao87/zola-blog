## Hello! 👋🏽

I'm an A.I. engineer with a passion for building intelligent, automated applications using a range of databases, tools and frameworks. I'm based in Toronto 🇨🇦 and have previously lived in Vancouver, B.C. 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor, MI 🇺🇸.

Although I've been coding in Python for 10+ years, I love nerding out on Rust 🦀, a programming language I believe is going to revolutionize computing this decade and beyond. 

This site is built using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), a fast, lightweight static site generator written in Rust, so have fun reading and let's build more things in Rust! 💪🏽

If you like what you read here, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/prrao87) -- and let's continue to support open knowledge sharing 🫶🏼.
