## Hello! 👋🏽

<div class="home-container">

  <div class="home-content">

I'm an A.I. engineer with a passion for building intelligent, automated applications using a range
of databases, tools and frameworks. My primary interests include database systems, knowledge graphs,
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

I'm currently based in Toronto 🇨🇦, and have previously lived in Vancouver 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor,
Michigan 🇺🇸. I love writing technical content and digging into the internals of tools and
frameworks, typically in Python and Rust. I'm also a big fan of open source software and open
knowledge-sharing. If you like what you're reading in the [blog](./posts), consider
