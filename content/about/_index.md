## Welcome to my blog! 👋🏽

I'm an A.I. engineer with a passion for building intelligent, automated applications using a range of databases, tools and frameworks. I'm based in Toronto, Ontario 🇨🇦 and have previously lived in Vancouver (British Columbia), London (U.K.) and Ann Arbor (Michigan). I have a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, one in Aerospace Engineering and another in Computer Science.

Although I've been coding in Python for 10+ years, I love nerding out on Rust 🦀, a programming language I genuinely believe is going to revolutionize computing in this decade and beyond.

This site is built using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), a fast, lightweight static site generator written in Rust, so have fun reading, and let's build more things in Rust! 💪🏽
