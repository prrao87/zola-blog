## Welcome to my blog! 👋🏽

I'm an A.I. and data systems engineer based in Toronto 🇨🇦, and have previously lived in Vancouver 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor, MI 🇺🇸. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and two master's degrees, one in Aerospace Engineering and another in Computer Science.

Although I primarily work in Python, I love nerding out on Rust 🦀, a language I genuinely believe is going to revolutionize computing in this decade and beyond.

In fact, this site is built using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), a fast, lightweight static site generator written in Rust. I hope you have fun reading, and let's go build more things in Rust! 💪🏽
