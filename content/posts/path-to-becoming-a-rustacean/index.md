## Coming to Rust from Python

I've been a long-time Python developer, and it's become more and more obvious to me lately that there's something stirring in the east. In fact, if you've read some of my [earlier posts](https://thedataquarry.com/tags/rust/), you'll know that I've been digging into the internals of the tooling in the PyData ecosystem and found a lot of Rust already exists under the hood of various tools we're familar with.


## Why Rust?

The two-world problem.

## Drafting a learning path

During the course of my journey, I've done everything from reading books, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, and even writing my own Rust code. I've also been following Rustaceans on Twitter, and I've found that to be a great way to keep up to date with the community out there who are passionate about building great software and tooling.

Now that it's clear *why* I'm learning Rust, I want to share a sequence of steps that I've found to be invaluable in remaining engaged and highly motivated in my journey.

### 1. Understand what makes Rust great





### 2. Consume all the content

In my journey, I learned that Rust is a language with a lot of history and *lore* (Ferris and Corro).

### 3. Embrace the meme game

Learning is about having fun -- when the going gets tough, the best way to keep at it is by laughing at yourself. Rust's meme game is strong!

### 4. Apply it to your existing problems

Don't just follow what the books say -- that's the fastest path to boredom. Try to apply it to your existing problems that you already know how to solve in the language you're coming from.

### 5. Document your journey publicly

This really helps with accountability, and also helps others who are in the same boat as you. Building and experimenting in private leads to drop-offs and dead ends, and it's all too easy to fall of the wagon without any accountability. You can always ask for help on Discord.

### 6. Spread the word

Once you have a handle on the core concepts, you'll find yourself naturally thinking about your code in a way that encapsulates the Rust way of doing things -- performance, safety and low resource utilization. Before you know it, you'll find yourself evangelizing Rust to your friends and colleagues, not to mention you'll be posting about your work publicly and collaborating with like-minded people who've gotten there before you did.

## Conclusions

It's very easy to feel impostor syndrome when you're learning a language like Rust. Jon Gjengset mentions this in his book, Rust for Rustaceans, that it's often hard to know when you can begin calling yourself a Rustacean. Having spent some serious time on this topic this year, I've come to frame it the following way: 

> *If you find yourself thinking about Rust, writing Rust code, or simply spreading the word having understood why it matters, you are a Rustacean.*
